# Mind Oasis: A Mental Health Application

**Project Overview**

Mind Oasis is a capstone project built as a comprehensive mental health application. It is designed to cater to two distinct user groups: adults seeking general mental wellness support and children with dyslexia and ADHD who require engaging games for focus and memory improvement. The application integrates AI-powered features to provide a more personalized and effective user experience.

# Getting Started :memo:
## **1. Prerequisites**

You will need the following installed on your machine to run the project:

* Node.js (v18 or higher)

* npm

* MongoDB

## **2. Installation**

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies for both the frontend and the backend.

```
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/Manini21/Mental-Health-Application.git](https://github.com/Manini21/Mental-Health-Application.git)

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Mental-Health-Application

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Navigate to the backend directory
cd server

# Install backend dependencies

```

## **3. Running the Project**

To run the full application, you need to start both the frontend and the backend servers in separate terminals.

<ins> **Terminal 1: Start the Frontend** </ins>

Open a new terminal, navigate to the project's root directory, and run:

```npm run start```

This will launch the React application at http://localhost:3000.

<ins> **Terminal 2: Start the Backend** </ins>

Open a second terminal, navigate to the ```server``` directory, and run:

```node server.js```

This will start the Express backend at http://localhost:5000.

Important: You must have your local MongoDB server running for the backend to connect.
